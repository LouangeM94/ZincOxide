## Project Overview  
This project is part of the [Break Through Tech AI Program](https://www.breakthroughtech.org/), where we are participating in the **[AJL/WiDS Challenge]** on Kaggle.
The goal of this competition is to develop a **machine learning model** that can [briefly describe what your model is predicting].  

### **Project Description**  
This competition focuses on applying machine learning techniques to analyze **[dataset name]** and improve prediction accuracy for **[problem statement]**. We will:  
- Perform **data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA)**.  
- Develop and evaluate **different machine learning models**.  
- Optimize performance through **feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning**.  

### **Why This Matters**  
This challenge has **real-world significance**, as it addresses **[describe the impact of solving this problem]**. Our contributions could help **[explain the broader impact]**.  

## Data Exploration  
We are using the dataset provided by Kaggle:  
- **Dataset Name**: [Link to Kaggle dataset]  
- **Additional Sources** (if applicable)  

### **Data Preprocessing & Cleaning**  
- Handled missing values  
- Normalized numerical features  
- Encoded categorical variables  
- Addressed class imbalance using **[technique]**  

### **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
Below are some key insights from our data analysis:  
- **Feature distributions**  
- **Correlations between variables**  
- **Patterns in missing data**

## Model Development  
We are testing multiple models, including:  
- **Baseline Models**: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree  
- **Advanced Models**: Random Forest, XGBoost, Neural Networks  

### **Evaluation Metrics**  
We use **[metrics like accuracy, F1-score, ROC-AUC, etc.]** to measure performance.  

## Next Steps  
- **Hyperparameter tuning**  
- **Feature selection improvements**  
- **Model deployment (if applicable)**
